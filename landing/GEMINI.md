# Gemini Code Assistant Project Configuration

This file contains project-specific configuration and instructions for the Gemini Code Assistant, helping it understand your project's structure, conventions, and tasks.

## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** tradeapi-landing
- **Description:** This project is a landing page for a Trade API, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It includes a component to display API documentation generated from protobuf specifications.
- **Primary Language(s):** TypeScript
- **Key Frameworks/Libraries:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Bootstrap, ESLint

## 2. Core Commands

Here are the essential commands for developing, building, and maintaining this project.

### Development Server
- **Command:** `npm run dev`
- **Description:** Starts the Vite development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). This command also runs `npm run generate-api` first to ensure the API specification (`src/api-spec.json`) is up-to-date.

### Build for Production
- **Command:** `npm run build`
- **Description:** Compiles the TypeScript code, generates the API specification, and builds the application for production. The output is placed in the `dist` directory.

### Linting
- **Command:** `npm run lint`
- **Description:** Runs ESLint to check the codebase for style and quality issues based on the configuration in `eslint.config.js`.

### Preview Production Build
- **Command:** `npm run preview`
- **Description:** Starts a local server to preview the production build from the `dist` directory.

### API Specification Generation
- **Command:** `npm run generate-api`
- **Description:** Manually triggers the generation of the `src/api-spec.json` file from the project's `.proto` files. This is automatically run as part of the `dev` and `build` commands.

## 3. Coding Style & Conventions

- **Formatting:** The project uses ESLint for code style. Please adhere to the rules defined in `eslint.config.js`.
- **Component Structure:** Components are located in `src/components`. Follow the existing pattern of creating a directory for each component containing its `.tsx` file.
- **Styling:** The project uses `react-bootstrap` for UI components and custom styles located in `src/styles/custom.css`.
- **Type Safety:** The project is written in TypeScript. Ensure all new code is strongly typed.

## 4. File & Directory Structure

- `src/`: Contains all the application source code.
- `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
- `src/pages/`: Top-level page components that assemble the layout.
- `src/services/`: Contains logic for handling data, such as parsing the API specification.
- `src/api-spec.json`: The generated API specification. **Do not edit this file directly.** It is generated by the `npm run generate-api` command.
- `scripts/`: Contains build-related scripts, specifically `generate-api-spec.cjs` for parsing proto files.
- `public/`: Static assets that are served directly.
- `dist/`: The production build output directory.
